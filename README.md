### Gameplay/About the Game

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a "1" is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a "1", he/she scores nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to his/her turn total score and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", his/her turn total score is added to the global score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
